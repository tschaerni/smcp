known issues:

 - It is not checked if a screen session $ SCREENSESSION exist. If the server is down, but the session is still active, there may be complications.
	
	Solution: Manually stop the StarMade server and terminate the session. Then start normally.

 - The cleaning of the database's npc mob of more than 100 entries takes a moment and brings the server to a halt for a short time (10-60s).

	There isn't a solution because the database do this job.
