Todo List:

[ ]	improve the screen-session check feature (is implementet but isn't really working)
[ ]	improve the layout of the source (has some ugly tab/whitespace changes)
[ ]	implement an improved control function (the probe one from Mikuz isn't really working)
[ ]	write an install script with some checks about requirements
[ ]	write an broadcast service for server messages.
[ ]	implement a search function for the logs to make that annoying thing easier
[X]	remove the german version (it makes more sense when i do the changes on one script ;)
[ ]	mobclean feature + crontab
[ ]	implement backupfunctions for Database / config files
[ ]	uptime display

eventually coming features:

	- a Language file, so it is easier to translate the text to other languages

	- eventually a lib file for the functions, it make the script smaller

	- a single config file for both scripts

	- menus with dialog (the ncurses one)
